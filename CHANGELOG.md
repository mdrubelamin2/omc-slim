# Changelog

Notable releases. Full reasoning for each is in
[RESEARCH.md](./RESEARCH.md) and [MAINTAINERS.md](./MAINTAINERS.md).

## Unreleased

Adopted from [svy04/ballast](https://github.com/svy04/ballast), pinned at
`acdf495b` in [`UPSTREAM.tsv`](./UPSTREAM.tsv). Most of that plugin was read and
refused — see [PROVENANCE.md](./docs/PROVENANCE.md).

**The hook was skipping its check on the agents doing the most work.**
`MAX_TRANSCRIPT_BYTES` was 2 MB. Sampled 2026-08-17, **89% of subagent
transcripts over that cap contain a successful write** (39 of 44 locally), so the
guard went silent exactly where a long `fixer` run needed it. Raised to 64 MB.
The largest transcript sampled is 50,017,698 bytes and parses in 145 ms against
the 5 s timeout, so the cap now bounds allocation rather than scan time.

**The hook has a test.** `node hooks/verify-deliverables.test.mjs` runs it as a
child process against isolated fixtures at real transcript depth — 13 cases, zero
dependencies. It covers the bare-name split for `omc-slim:fixer`, both write
agents, every write tool, read-only exemption, a denied write counting as no
deliverable, `agent_transcript_path` over the parent's, malformed stdin, both
sides of the cap, and that debug output goes to stderr and never corrupts stdout.

It asserts the **exact set of keys** the hook may emit, which is what pins "never
blocks" and "never sends `additionalContext`". Neither is visible to an exit-code
assertion: `continue: false` halts a session while still exiting 0.

**And the test has a test.** `node hooks/verify-deliverables.mutate.mjs` breaks
the hook fifteen ways and asserts the harness notices every time — **15/15**. It
exists because the first draft of the harness passed 9/9 while missing nine of
eleven mutants, including both invariants above. A suite that cannot fail is not
evidence. It restores the hook by sha256, so an interrupted run leaves nothing
behind.

Together these replace two one-time manual checks that survived only as dated
comments; a dated comment cannot fail. Both now point at the case that re-runs
them.

**`OMC_SLIM_DEBUG=1`** traces which of the four "cannot tell" paths the hook
took. stderr from a hook that exits 0 never reaches the user, so it adds no
noise.

**The delegation contract now carries standing rules and earlier corrections.** A
specialist sees only what the brief says. For a plugin whose whole thesis is
delegation, that gap was the characteristic failure. The hard gate stays on the
validation owner — a fourth mandatory field would be unsatisfiable on the many
briefs that have no standing rule to carry.

**A passing check can go stale.** "Do not re-run a check whose inputs have not
changed" was silent about time, so a check against an external API or contract
passed forever.

**The progress file records dead ends and a next first action.** An approach that
failed and went unwritten gets walked a second time by whoever picks the work up
next. The next action must be executable without reading anything but that file.

**`verification-planning` gained the zero-context executor.** A deliverable
meant to work without you is checked by a fresh agent that receives it and
nothing else, then executes rather than reviews it.

**The README now says which parts are enforced.** `disallowedTools`, the
output-style flag and the hook matcher are harness-enforced; one hook is our
code; everything else is prose and holds as well as a prompt holds.

**Static context 4,406 → 4,462 tokens** (+1.3%), all of it in the two output-style
additions. `.claude/settings.local.json` is now ignored by the repo rather than
by one machine's global config.

## v0.8.2

**Per-agent `model:` and `effort:` pinning removed.** Every agent now inherits
the caller's model. Note what this means for cost: `explorer` and `librarian`
previously ran on a cheaper tier, and now run on whatever you are running. The
roster costs what your session costs.

**Re-benchmarked at n=3**, with the harness committed at `scripts/bench/` so the
numbers are re-derivable rather than asserted. omc-slim costs **18% less than a
plain session** at equal correctness, reversing the v0.4.1 finding of 10% more.
The benchmark ran before the model change, and no specialist fired during it, so
that result measures the orchestrator prompt rather than tier routing. See
[BENCHMARK.md](./docs/BENCHMARK.md), including the four measurement bugs found
before publishing.

**Static context measured, not estimated.** `scripts/measure-context.sh` reports
4,406 tokens. The README had been quoting two different totals for the same
plugin, because both were counted by hand and nothing could re-derive them.

**README rebuilt**, 562 lines to 181. Routing measurements, limitations and
provenance moved to `docs/`; release history moved here.

## v0.8.1

`deepwork` auto-invocation solved: the cause was the injection point, not the
wording. Eight rewrites inside the output style changed nothing; the same
sentences in a `CLAUDE.md` fire it on the first tool call.

## v0.8.0

`fixer` writes to the same standard the reviewers hold it to.

## v0.7.4 – v0.7.8

Simplified Technical English became the default register. `simplify` learned to
spot comment smells. `review` now judges the whole change set rather than the
diff.

Three separate files hit the same compression floor at ~2%, so that pattern is
established rather than suspected.

## v0.7.0 – v0.7.3

Added `review`, the all-axis code-review skill, behind an evidence gate. It
checks current sources and installed tooling rather than recalled knowledge.

## v0.6.4 – v0.6.9

`simplify` merged from all four upstream sources, then audited and compressed
28%. The orchestrator lost 250 tokens with no behaviour change.

## v0.6.0 – v0.6.1

The output style now names every agent and skill, because the descriptions
Claude Code shows get dropped once enough plugins are installed. On a 41k-LOC
repository that turned `oracle` and `librarian` from never firing into firing on
turn one.

The same pass removed the `observer` agent. Claude Code reads images and PDFs
natively, so it never auto-fired; forced, it matched the direct path while being
unable to cross-reference the repo.
